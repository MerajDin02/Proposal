# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Invasion.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Will be a game like Space Invaders where you will have to shoot down alien ships, it will be a 2d game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In our game “The Invasion”, we will have a spaceship that can only move left and right to try to take down alien ships and try to avoid getting hit by the alien ships who are also attacking you. If the alien ship gets hit, it will be destroyed and it will increase your score by 100 but if the player's spaceship gets hit, they will lose a life and they will only have a total of 3 lives. The main goal of the game is to get the highest score as possible.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No, we will not be combining another course’s final project with this final project.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Name: Kevin Wu
Email: tuk30625@temple.edu
TA: Elmira Talebianaraki

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so, it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for the game would be for it to work properly.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for this project could be if we are done with the coding before the deadline so we can focus on making the spectacles better.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for our project would be if it is running as intended with no bugs. I would also like for it to be visually appealing.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps are to do as much research about the game Space Invaders since our game is inspired by it. We need to look up what Space Invaders looks like so we have a general idea on how our game should look, obviously not using the same assets as the original. My partner and I will need to acquire new skills as this is new to us, so we will need to figure out how to get the game operational and then how to make it look like a 2d spacecraft shooter game.
